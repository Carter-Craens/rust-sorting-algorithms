# Rust Sorting Algorithms

A comprehensive collection of classic, modern, and specialized sorting algorithms implemented in Rust for learning, benchmarking, and experimentation.

This goal of this project is to create and learn:
- Clean, idiomatic Rust
- Multiple algorithm families
- High-quality benchmarking and comparisons

## Implemented Algorithms

### Comparison-Based Sorts

- [ ] Selection Sort (`selection.rs`)
- [ ] Insertion Sort (`insertion.rs`)
- [ ] Merge Sort (`merge.rs`)
- [ ] Quick Sort (`quick.rs`)
- [ ] Heap Sort (`heap.rs`)
- [ ] Shell Sort
- [ ] TimSort (`tim.rs`)
- [ ] IntroSort (`intro.rs`)
- [ ] Smoothsort (`smooth.rs`)
- [ ] Tree Sort (`tree.rs`)
- [ ] Tournament Sort (`tournament.rs`)
- [ ] Patience Sort (`patience.rs`)
- [ ] Library Sort (`library.rs`)
- [ ] Strand Sort (`strand.rs`)
- [ ] Block Sort (`block.rs`)
- [ ] External Merge Sort (`exMerge.rs`)

---

### Non-Comparison / Distribution Sorts

- [ ] Counting Sort (`counting.rs`)
- [ ] Bucket Sort (`bucket.rs`)
- [ ] Flash Sort (`flash.rs`)
- [ ] LSD Radix Sort (`LSD.rs`, `LSDRad.rs`)
- [ ] MSD Radix Sort (`MSD.rs`, `MSDRad.rs`)
- [ ] American Flag Sort (`aFlag.rs`)
- [ ] Spreadsort (`spread.rs`)
- [ ] Sample Sort (`sample.rs`)
- [ ] Polyphase Merge Sort (`poly.rs`)

---

### String / Hybrid / Advanced

- [ ] Burstsort (`burst.rs`)
- [ ] Three-Way Radix QuickSort (`threeRad.rs`)
- [ ] Shear Sort (`shear.rs`)
- [ ] Bitonic Sort (`biton.rs`)
- [ ] Odd-Even Merge Sort (`oddEve.rs`)

---

## Benchmarking & Evaluation

Planned:
- Performance comparisons across input sizes
- Cache behavior analysis
- Stability and memory usage profiling
- Algorithm family comparisons (e.g., Quick vs Intro vs Tim)
- To be created after the first set of sorts and iterated as I become more comfortable with rust

---

## Goals

- Unified trait-based sorting interface
- Support for numeric, string, and record sorting
- Feature-gated benchmarking suite
- Well-documented implementations
- Educational clarity + real-world performance

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete core comparison sorts
- [ ] Implement non-comparison integer sorts
- [ ] Add string-optimized algorithms
- [ ] Build benchmark framework
- [ ] Publish performance report to finish~
